<h2>What is Bitcoin Mining?</h2>

<h2>Is Bitcoin Mining a Waste of Electricity?</h2>

Many have criticized mining as wasteful. It's important to remember that this electricity is used for securing the Bitcoin network. Consider that fiat currency requires banks (which also use tons of electricity), employees salaries, and physical printing and money creation. The existing systems also uses electricity, wastes time and human resources! Plus, Bitcoin mining is voluntary and miners must cover electricity costs from their own pocket.
