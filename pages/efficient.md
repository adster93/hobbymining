Good [Bitcoin mining hardware](/mining-hardware/) needs to have a high hash rate. But, efficiency is just as important. 

An efficient Bitcoin miner means that you pay less in electricity costs per hash. 

The miners in the table below are currently the most efficient Bitcoin miners on the market. 

<table class="m-comparison">
  <tr>
  	<th></th>
    <th>Miner</th>
    <th>Hash Power<br></th>
    <th class="miner-price">Price</th>
    <th class="miner-buy">Buy</th>
  </tr>
  {% for miner in site.pages %}
  {% if miner.tags contains "efficient" %}
  {% include compare.html %}
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

The [Avalon6](http://amzn.to/1VsHXkA) gets 0.29 Watts/GH, but costs more than $200 more than the Antminer S7. 

The Antminer S7 is more efficient, with 0.25 Watts/GH. The Antminer S7 also costs much less, and comes with 4.5 TH/s of hash power compared to the Avalon6's 3.50 TH/s.

The [AntMiner S7](http://amzn.to/26frgMW) is clearly the better option between these two miners, which are currently the most efficient miners available for purchase.
