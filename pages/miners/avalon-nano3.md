## Bitcoins per Month (Profit)

You will earn about $1 per year with the Avalon Nano 3, which is less than 10 cents per month. 

## Power Consumption

This miner will use slightly more electricity via your computer, but nothing noticeable unless you are trying to use it with a laptop that isn't plugged in. Now that would drain your battery fast! 

## Price

The cheapest place to buy an Avalon 3 is [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5574973039&toolid=10001&campid=5337804727&customid=&icep_uq=Avalon+Nano+3&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg), where they go for about $20. 

## Setup 

You will need to setup your miner with [mining software](http://guiminer.org/) and also decide on a [Bitcoin mining pool](/bitcoin-mining-pools/). 

## Temperature

There is no need to worry about temperature or fans with any type of USB miner. They don't get hot enough to require a fan. 

## Power Supply

No power supply is required. Just plug into your computer's USB port and start mining!
