## Antminer R4: The Perfect Home Bitcoin Miner

The Antminer R4 is BitMain's latest and most unique Bitcoin miner yet. We're here to put all of the most important information in one place in this review. 

## Hash Rate

The Antminer R4 hashes at up to 8.6 TH/s, making it the second fastest miner behind the [Antminer S9](/bitmain-antminer-s9/) and [just ahead](/mining-hardware/) of the Antminer S7.

## Efficiency

The R4's efficiency of 0.098 J/GHs is tied with the S9 as the most efficient Bitcoin miner on the market. Here is a [direct quote](https://enshop.bitmain.com/adv/antminer-r4-silent-bitcoin-miner.html) from Bitmain's website: 

> Bitmain's BM1387 chip is built using TSMC's 16nm FinFET technology and, delivering a record-breaking 0.098 J/GHs, is the world's most efficient bitcoin mining chip in the consumer market.

The R4 is so efficient because it uses the 126 of Bitmain's new BM1387 ASIC Chips, which are 16nm chips. [BitFury](http://bitfury.com/products) was the first company to [release 16nm chips](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitfury-will-mass-produce-fastest-and-most-effective-16nm-asic-miner-chips/). 

## Price

As the saying goes nothing good comes cheap. With all the awesome features that come with the Antminer R4 you would expect its price to be high. One Antminer R4 costs $1,000. Its price is among its cons because this may be too high for the average hobby miner.

## Ease of Use

Once you setup your Antminer R4 you will see that its user interface has been well designed with the users in mind. It's very easy to use. All you have to do is enter your wallet address and [mining pool](/bitcoin-mining-pools/) settings before you start mining. It is also possible for you to customize settings such as the fan speed or the frequency.

## Bitcoin / month (profitability): 

Most of the hobby miners reading this article actually want to make money from hashing. With that in mind let's have an in-depth look at the profitability of Antminer R4:

With a hash rate of 8.6 TH/s, the Antminer R4 is the second most powerful miner, second to the [Antminer S9](/bitmain-antminer-s9/). It has a power consumption of approximately 845 Watts at the wall using an APW5 PSU power supply. Rest easy because most homes have an outlet that can handle 845 Watts safely but also expect your electricity bills to rise significantly. Consider an investment of about $1,000 for the Antminer R4 and about $240 for the APW5 PSU.

The BitcoinX mining profit calculator reports at the then current price of $574 Bitcoin price, it would take you approximately 527 days to return your investment provided your power cost doesn’t exceed $0.10 per KwH. Of course we assume that all factors remain constant which is almost impossible in the ever-changing world of Bitcoin.

This means that the Antminer R4 will eventually produce a profit, but only if the network hash rate, Bitcoin price, and electricty costs stay the same. All of those factors are a big IF, since the network difficulty almost always increases. 

So you are definitely taking on risk with this miner, and it may not be worth your time despite the many benefits it provides over other hardware. 

## Low Sound

One ofhe most unique features of Antminer R4 is that it was designed to ensure the least possible sound with the maximum hash rate. 

Antminer R4 replaces the traditional fan with a rotary blade system. The traditional fan has been the biggest source of noise for other mining hardware. The Antminer R4 fan was inspired by the fan of a silent split air conditioner and it reduces the noise of a standard miner by 50% at a noise level of 51 db. Its fan speed is controlled automatically, ensuring that the noise is regulated.

## Power Supply

Antminer R4 uses the most advanced Power Supply Unit (PSU) to date. Bitmain recommends the use of an APW5 power supply. The APW5 works with both 220v and 110v input to deliver 2600 Watts and 1300 Watts respectively. The APW5 retails for about $240.

## Special Design Control Board

The Antminer R4 employs the Xilinx’s ZYNQ-7000 family system-on-a-chip that integrates a feature-rich core ARM Cortez – A9 based processing system. It also uses 28nm Xilinx programmable logic. It supports Gigabit Ethernet to ensure that mined blocks are submitted instantly.

## Final Thoughts

Mining bitcoins at home has almost become an impossible task these days. Not only are the devices expensive but they also generate a lot of heat and noise, not to mention the amount of electricity they consume. This makes it uncomfortable and almost impossible to make any profit! 

With Antminer R4, Bitmain is targeting the home Bitcoin miner market. Some of these problems mentioned above have been addressed and as a miner you can do it as a hobby while also making some money. This home Bitcoin miner is not only a good fit for hobby miners but also helps to improve the decentralization of Bitcoin mining as a whole. The more distributed  the hash power, the stronger the Bitcoin network!
