## Antminer R4: The Perfect Home Bitcoin Miner

The Antminer R4 is BitMain's latest and most unique Bitcoin miner yet. Although it only goes on sale on August 30th, we're here to put all of the most important information in one place in this review. 

## Hash Rate

The Antminer R4 hashes at up to 8.6 TH/s, making it the second fastest miner behind the [Antminer S9](/bitmain-antminer-s9/) and [just ahead](/mining-hardware/) of the Antminer S7.

## Efficiency

The R4's efficiency of 0.098 J/GHs is tied with the S9 as the most efficient Bitcoin miner on the market. Here is a [direct quote](https://enshop.bitmain.com/adv/antminer-r4-silent-bitcoin-miner.html) from Bitmain's website: 

> Bitmain's BM1387 chip is built using TSMC's 16nm FinFET technology and, delivering a record-breaking 0.098 J/GHs, is the world's most efficient bitcoin mining chip in the consumer market.

The R4 is so efficient because it uses the 126 of Bitmain's new BM1387 ASIC Chips, which are 16nm chips. [BitFury](http://bitfury.com/products) was the first company to [release 16nm chips](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitfury-will-mass-produce-fastest-and-most-effective-16nm-asic-miner-chips/). 

## Low-noise Fan

Bitmain claims that the R4's fan, which is attached and included with the miner, reduces the noise an average Bitcoin mining cooling fan makes by 50%. 

## Final Thoughts

This home Bitcoin miner by Bitmain is not only a good fit for hobby miners, but should also help improve the decentralization of Bitcoin mining as a whole. The more distributed  the hash power, the stronger the Bitcoin network!
