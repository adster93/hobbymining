## The Avalon 6: Serious Rival to the AntMiner S7

[Canaan Creative](http://canaan.io/en/) took over the troubled Avalon brand. They’ve been restoring the brand to its former glory with their recent hardware offerings. Their latest device, the impressive Avalon 6, contains eighty 18nm A3218 chips, running at 500 MHz to achieve a respectable 3.5 TH/s hashrate which approaches that of the AntMiner S7.

## Power Supply

Any good power supply of 1100W and up will run the Avalon 6\. The unit draws about 1050 Watts when using a platinum-rated PSU.

## Bitcoins / Month (Profitability)

The imminent halving combined with a rising Bitcoin price may allow the Avalon 6 to turn a profit despite the release of the 14 TH/s AntMiner S9\. We’ll run the Avalon stats and some average costs through [CoinWarz’mining profitability calculator](http://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/bitcoin-mining-calculator):

And the results, while in the minus column, aren’t too bad. A lower electricity cost or higher Bitcoin price could nudge the Avalon 6 into profit:

## Price

Canaan sell the unit for $550 (with substantial $100 and $130 discounts for 10 and 50 units respectively). For shipping purposes, the unit weighs 5 kg / 11 lb. Used, it costs about $450 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Spondoolies-Tech-Jackson-1-3-1-7TH-Bitcoin-Miner/dp/B00RC288E4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466428803&sr=8-1&keywords=spondoolies+sp20) .

## Noise

At 55 dB from 1.2 m. / 4 ft., the Avalon 6 is quiet enough to run at home, although not in your bedroom or living room. Underclocking the unit will further reduce noise.

## Setup

The Avalon 6 requires either a Raspberry Pi (B / B+) or a TP-Link TL-WR703N as a controller. Up to 50 miners can be maintained from one RPi.

It uses DHCP so it automatically finds an IP address, making for an easy installation.

You can use either Avalon’s control panel or CGminer to setup, control and monitor the device. Basic and advanced settings are easy to access.

## Temperature

The frequency of the Avalon 6 can be easily adjusted from its standard 500 MHz and it runs fairly cool even when overclocked. It is intended for operation at an ambient temperature below 35^C / 95^F. The single fan has no problem cooling the unit due to the unit’s design.

## Verdict

The Avalon 6 is a strong rival to the AntMiner S7\. It’s slightly less energy-efficient but arguably makes up for it with enough customization options to please any hardware enthusiast.
