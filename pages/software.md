## What is Bitcoin Mining Software?

Now that you already know about the [best Bitcoin mining hardware](/mining-hardware/), we're going to talk about Bitcoin mining software. Bitcoin mining hardware handles the actual Bitcoin mining process, but Bitcoin mining software is equally as important. If you are a solo miner then mining software connects your Bitcoin miner to the blockchain. If you mine with a pool then the software will connect you to your [mining pool](/bitcoin-mining-pools/).

## Importance of Bitcoin Mining Software

The main job of the software is to deliver the mining hardware's work to the rest of the Bitcoin network and to receive the completed work from other miners on the network.

Bitcoin mining software monitors this input and output of your miner while also displaying statistics such as the speed of your miner, hashrate, fan speed and the temperature.

## Bitcoin Wallets

One of the most important things you will need before using any kind of Bitcoin mining software is a wallet. This is because all Bitcoin mining software will ask you for a Bitcoin address that will be used to send your mining rewards and payouts. Once you create or download a wallet you will be able to get a Bitcoin address from your wallet. 

There are many Bitcoin wallets, but these are the ones we recommend if you are just starting out: 

* **[Electrum](https://electrum.org/)** - Simple Bitcoin wallet that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. 
* **[Mycelium](https://wallet.mycelium.com/)** - The most popular Bitcoin wallet on Android. 
* **[breadwallet](https://breadwallet.com/)** - The most popular Bitcoin wallet for iOS. 
 
If you expect to earn a lot of money through mining then it would be smart to purchase a more secure wallet: a hardware wallet. If you are just getting into it the [Ledger Nano S](http://buybitcoinww.co/Ledger_Nano_S) costs about $60 and will keep your coins super secure.  

Now that we understand mining software and how it helps in the mining process, and you got your Bitcoin wallet and address, let's look at different software on different operating systems.

## Bitcoin Mining Software for Windows

### Bitcoin Miner

You can use [Bitcoin Miner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/bitcoin-miner/9wzdncrdhxb6) on Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. It has an easy to use interface, power saving mode, mining pool support and fast share submission. One useful feature is the profit reports feature because this feature will help you know if your mining is profitable or not. The latest version of this software is Bitcoin Miner 1.27.0.

### BTCMiner

[BTCMiner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BTCMiner) is an Open Source Bitcoin Miner for ZTEX USB-FPGA modules 1.5. BTCMiner comes with the following features: dynamic frequency scaling in that BTCMiner automatically chooses the frequency with the highest rate of valid hashes, ready-to-use Bitstream i.e. no Xilinx software or license required. It also comes with supported FPGA boards which contain a USB interface used for communication and programming.

### CGMiner

[CGMiner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CGMiner) is arguably the most famous and the most common software among Bitcoin miners at the moment. CGMiner is based on the original code of CPU Miner. This software has many features but the main ones include: fan speed control, remote interface capabilities, self-detection of new blocks with a mini database, multi GPU support and CPU mining support.

### BFGMiner

[BFGMiner](http://bfgminer.org/) is more or less the same as CGMiner. The only major difference is that it doesn’t focus on GPUs like CGMiner but instead it is designed specifically for ASICs. Some unique features of BFGMiner include: mining with free mesa/LLVM OpenCL, ADL device reordering by PCI bus ID, integrated overclocking and fan control.

### EasyMiner

[EasyMiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/easyminer/) is a GUI based software and it acts as a convenient wrapper for CGMiner and BFGMiner software. This software supports the getwork mining protocol as well as stratum mining protocol. It can also be used for both solo and pooled mining. Among its main features is that it configures your miner and provides performance graphs for easy visualization of your mining activity.

## Bitcoin Mining Software for Linux

### BitMinter

BitMinter was designed for pool mining, having not mentioned any software that can be used by pool miners I think it’s only fair that at least I mention one of those. This software is one of the best, if not the best, when it comes to connecting users with potential clients. Since BitMinter was developed in 2011 over 375,000 people have registered their accounts with them. This software has straight forward functionalities and user-friendly interface.

### CGMiner

This software is arguably the most famous and the most common software among Bitcoin’s miners at the moment. CGMiner is based on the original code of CPU Miner which in my opinion makes it more popular mostly on the conservatives. This software has many features but I only will mention the main ones which include: fans speed control, remote interface capabilities, self-detection of new blocks with a mini database and multi GPU support and CPU mining support.

### BFGMiner

BFGMiner is more or less the same as CGMiner with the only major difference being it doesn’t focus on GPUs like CGMiner but instead it is designed specifically for FPGA and AISCs. This software has some very interesting features that are worth looking at. These features include: supports mining with free mesa/LLVM OpenCL, ADL device reordering by PCI bus ID, integrated overclocking and fan control.

### EasyMiner

EasyMiner is a GUI based software and it acts as a convenient wrapper for CGMiner and BFGMiner software. This software supports the getwork mining protocol as well as stratum mining protocol. It can also be used for both solo and pooled mining therefore making it very convenient. Among its main features is that it configures your miner and provides performance graphs for easy visualization of your Bitcoin mining activity.

## Bitcoin Mining Software for Mac OS X

### RPC Miner

This software can be used on Mac OS 10.6 or higher and features integration with Mac OS APIs and systems.

### CGMiner

This software is arguably the most famous and the most common software among Bitcoin’s miners at the moment. CGMiner is based on the original code of CPU Miner which in my opinion makes it more popular mostly on the conservatives. This software has many features but I will only mention the main ones which include: fans speed control, remote interface capabilities, self-detection of new blocks with a mini database and multi GPU support and CPU mining support.

### BFGMiner

It can also be used for both solo and pooled mining therefore making it very convenient. Among its main features is that it configures your miner and provides performance graphs for easy visualization of your Bitcoin mining activity.

You may have noticed that I have included some of the software in each of the three categories i.e. Windows, Linux and Mac OS. This is because am of the view that the best Bitcoin mining software should run on almost any operating system as this gives you flexibility which is a very important factor in this ever changing world of Bitcoin mining.

## Cash Out your Coins

Once you have setup your software and are mining, you may need to cash out some of your coins in order to pay off your expenses such as electricity. For this you can use [Buy Bitcoin Worldwide](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) to find a Bitcoin exchange in your country.
