Gone are the days of mining bitcoin from your computer with a Bitcoin USB miner. Today, you need the best bitcoin mining hardware to compete with large scale mining operations in China. 

Hobby mining can still be fun and even slightly profitable if you have cheap electricity, a good bitcoin mining rig, and can find a place to get cheap Bitcoin mining hardware. 

If you're ready to get started, read on to learn about where to buy bitcoin miners and how to find the right hardware. 

## What is an ASIC Bitcoin Miner?

Since it's now impossible to mine Bitcoin with your computer, you'll need specialized hardware called ASICs. 

Originally, Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be mined on computer CPUs. However, Bitcoin miners discovered they could get more hashing power from graphic cards. Graphic cards were then surpassed by ASICs ([Application Specific Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)). 

Nowadays all serious Bitcoin mining is performed on dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware ASICs, usually in thermally-regulated data-centres with access to low-cost electricity. Think of a Bitcoin ASIC as specialized Bitcoin mining computers, Bitcoin mining machines, or "bitcoin generators".  

## How to Find the Best Bitcoin Miner

There are some important factors to look at when determing which Bitcoin mining ASIC to buy:

**Hash rate** - How many hashes per second? 

**Efficency** - You'll want to buy the most efficient bitcoin mining hardware possible. Since miners use a large amount of electricty, you want to buy one that converts the most amount of electricty into bitcoins. 

**Price** - How much does the bitcoin miner cost? Cheap mining hardware will mine less bitcoins, which is why efficiency and electricty usage are important. The fastest and more effecient mining hardware is going to cost more.

Don't try to buy a miner based on only price or only hash rate. The best ASIC miner is the **most effecient bitcoin miner.** Aim for value.

## Bitcoin Mining Without Hardware? 

It's still technically possible to mine bitcoins without dedicated mining hardware. However, you'll earn less than one penny per month. Mining bitcoins on your computer will do more damage to your computer and won't earn a profit. So, it's not worth it unless you're just interested to see how the mining process works. 

## USB Bitcoin Miners

Using a Bitcoin USB miner with your computer was once a profitable way to mine bitcoins. Today, however, USB miners don't generate enough hashing power to mine profitably. If you just want to get a Bitcoin miner USB to learn, a USB block erruprter is a good cheap Bitcoin miner. Some of your options are displayed below.

## Understanding Competition

Even if you buy mining hardware from Amazon or eBay, you're up against massive competition. Mining farms in China make up 60% of the Bitcoin network's hash rate. The video below will help you understand just how big mining farms in China really are:

## Hardware Wallets vs. Mining Hardware

Don't confuse Bitcoin hardware wallets and Bitcoin mining hardware. Mining hardware mines for bitcoins, while hardware wallets provide secure storage for bitcoins. For more information on hardware wallets, visit [Cold Hardware](https://www.coldhardware.com/).
