## What is an ASIC Bitcoin Miner?

Since it's now impossible to profitably mine Bitcoin with your computer, you'll need specialized hardware called ASICs. 

Originally, Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be mined on computer CPUs. However, Bitcoin miners discovered they could get more hashing power from graphic cards. Graphic cards were then surpassed by ASICs ([Application Specific Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)). 

Nowadays all serious Bitcoin mining is performed on dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware ASICs, usually in thermally-regulated data-centers with access to low-cost electricity. Think of a Bitcoin ASIC as specialized Bitcoin mining computers, Bitcoin mining machines, or "bitcoin generators".  

## How to Find the Best Bitcoin Miner

There are some important factors to look at when determening which Bitcoin mining ASIC to buy:

**Hash rate** - How many hashes per second can the Bitcoin miner make? More hashes cost more, which is why efficiency is crucial... 

**Efficiency** - You'll want to buy the most efficient bitcoin mining hardware possible. Since miners use a large amount of electricity, you want to buy one that converts the most amount of electricity into bitcoins. 

**Price** - How much does the bitcoin miner cost? Cheap mining hardware will mine less bitcoins, which is why efficiency and electricity usage are important. The fastest and more effecient mining hardware is going to cost more.

Don't try to buy a miner based on only price or only hash rate. The best ASIC miner is the **most effecient bitcoin miner.** Aim for value.

## Bitcoin Miners for Sale on Amazon

If you're a hobby miner who wants to buy a couple rigs for your house, Amazon has some decent deals on mining hardware. 

The [Spondoolies-Tech SP20 Jackson](http://amzn.to/1NbfbLz){:rel="nofollow"} is available for about $350.00 and hashes at 1.3-1.7 TH/S. 

The [Antminer S7](http://amzn.to/1Nbfy95){:rel="nofollow"} comes in at $1,599.99, but mines at ~4.73TH/s.  

## Used Bitcoin Mining Hardware for Sale

Both new and used bitcoin mining rigs and ASICs are available on eBay. One may want to buy used ASIC mining hardware on eBay because you can get better prices. eBay's customer protection ensures you'll get a working product. Other bundles equipment may be included with your purchase depending on the seller. 

We recommend purchasing the <a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5574973039&toolid=10001&campid=5337804714&customid=&icep_uq=antminer+s7&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg">Antminer S7</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5574973039&toolid=10001&campid=5337804716&customid=&icep_uq=Spondoolies-Tech+SP20&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg">Spondoolies-Tech SP20</a>.

## Hardware Profitability

You can use a bitcoin mining profitability calculator to determine your estimated cost of return on your mining hardware. 

Be sure to take electricity costs into account. Most mining hardware appears profitable until electricity costs are accounted for. 

## Bitcoin Mining Hardware Companies

**[Bitmain](https://www.bitmaintech.com/product.htm)** - Bitmain makes the Antminer line of Bitcoin miners. Bitmain is based in China and also operates a mining pool. 

**[BitFury](http://www.bitfury.org/)** - BitFury is one of the largest producers of Bitcoin mining hardware and chips. Its hardware is not available for purchase. 

**[21 Inc.](https://21.co/)** - 21 Inc. is a Bitcoin mining company based in California. It sells low powered bitcoin miners as part of their 21 Bitcoin computer. 

**[Spondoolies Tech](http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/)** - Spondoolies Tech is an Israeli based mining hardware manufacturer.

## Bitcoin Mining Equipment

In addition to a Bitcoin mining ASIC, you'll need some other Bitcoin mining equipment:

* **Power Supply** - Bitcoin rigs need special power supplies to funnel and use electricity efficiently.

## Bitcoin Mining Without Hardware? 

It's still technically possible to mine bitcoins without dedicated mining hardware. However, you'll earn less than one penny per month. Mining bitcoins on your computer will do more damage to your computer and won't earn a profit. So, it's not worth it unless you're just interested to see how the mining process works. 

## USB Bitcoin Miners

Using a Bitcoin USB miner with your computer was once a profitable way to mine bitcoins. Today, however, USB miners don't generate enough hashing power to mine profitably. If you just want to get a Bitcoin miner USB to learn, a USB [block erupter from Amazon](http://amzn.to/1QaHMr0){:rel="nofollow"} or <a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5574973039&toolid=10001&campid=5337804727&customid=&icep_uq=bitcoin+usb+miner&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg">eBay</a> is a good cheap Bitcoin miner. Some of your options are displayed below.

## Understanding Competition

Even if you buy mining hardware from Amazon or eBay, you're up against massive competition. [Mining farms in China](/bitcoin-mining-in-china/) make up 60% of the Bitcoin network's hash rate. The video below will help you understand just how big mining farms in China really are:
