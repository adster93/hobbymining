China is a world leader in Bitcoin mining and trading. Chinese mining pools control more than 60% of the network hash rate. Massive mining farms are located in China and pointed at these mining pools. 

So, why is China the world's leader in Bitcoin mining? 

## Cheap Electricity

Electricity in China is cheap. Electricity costs is the most important factor for a profitable mining operation. As mining difficulty increases, the least effecient miners are forced to shut down first. China's cheap electricty keeps Chinese miners at peak efficiency and allows them to outlast their competitors. 

## Excess Coal

Energy producers can burn coal and use the energy for Bitcoin mining. Instead of physically moving coal, it's easy to just burn the coal and convert it into Bitcoin through mining.
