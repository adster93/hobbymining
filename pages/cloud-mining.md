Want to find the best Bitcoin cloud mining contracts? This post has you covered. 

## Most Bitcoin Cloud Mining Companies are Scams

Like the heading says, most cloud mining contracts are scams. Why? Because it's easy for companies to take peoples' money, and then not pay out. A company can claim to be a cloud mining company without any proof of actually owning any hardware. So remember: 99% of cloud mining companies are scams. 

## Which Companies Are Not Scams? 

There is only one cloud mining company we are willing to recommend on this site: [Genesis Mining](https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/453605). 

## Genesis Mining

Genesis Mining is Hong Kong based company although its founders are from Germany and attend many Bitcoin conferences. You can read more about Genesis Mining on their [about page](https://www.genesis-mining.com/about-us). 

Genesis Mining offers three different Bitcoin mining cloud contracts. All plans are paid with a one time payment and are lifetime contracts: 

**Gold**: 100 GH/s plan that costs $19. 

**Platinum**: 2,000 GH/s plan that costs $340. 

**Diamond**: 10,000 GH/s plan that costs $1,600. 

## Is Cloud Mining Profitable?

It depends what your goals are with cloud mining. If your goal is to obtain bitcoins, then there is really no reason to cloud mine or even mine at all. Just [buy bitcoins](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/)! 

If you think mining is cool and want to try, then cloud mining still is not a good option. Grab a [cheap USB miner](/usb-bitcoin-miners/) and run it at home.  

## Bitcoin Cloud Mining Comparison

Well, this is just a joke! Since we only recommend one company ([Genesis Mining](/genesis-mining-review/)) here there is no need for comparison. But check back in incase we find any new, legit cloud mining companies.
